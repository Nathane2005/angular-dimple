# Angular Boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate based on angular seed. It changes some of the punctuation, adds an example of a simple http service, and adds Sass, Compass, and a simple http server all wrapped in Grunt.

To use:

```
git clone git@github.com:paulcpederson/angular-boilerplate.git app
```

```
cd app/
```

```
npm install
```

This will give you all of the dependencies. Now you can just run `grunt` and there will be an angular app running on `localhost:8001`.
